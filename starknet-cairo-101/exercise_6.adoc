= Exercise 6

== External vs internal functions

In this exercise, you need to:

Follow this contract's claim_points() function to understand how to finish the exercise

You need to the exact same thing as the previous exercise

But this time, the external function you will call will call an inner function

step:

1. interact assign_user_slot(address); return nothing
2. get user's slot from `get_user_slots(address)`; return 0x12
3. excuse external_handler_for_internal_function(n) n!=0
4. excuse get_user_values(address)  return 4495
5. chlaim_points(4495)
done!
