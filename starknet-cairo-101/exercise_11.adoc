= Exercise 11

== Composability

        // CAREFUL THERE IS A TRAP FOR PEOPLE WHO WON'T READ THE CODE
        // This exercise looks like the previous one, but actually the view secret_value returns a different value than secret_value
        // Sending the wrong execution result will remove some of your points, then validate the exercise. You won't be able to get those points back later on!



step:
fn secret_value() -> u128 {
return secret_value_internal();
}
return is the fake number, which will sub you point 2 ,if you don't know the rule.
the real number is the facknumber - 42069

so:
1.chaim(facknumber - 42069,666)

done!
